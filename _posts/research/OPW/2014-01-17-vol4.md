I have to validate the correctness of the SDF editor as the user enters new entries or change some parts of it. Since the SDF file is based on XML, I have to check for XML syntax first and then for the SDF syntax. For the XML validator, I found the [Xerces C++ library](http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/) which can be used to parse, manipulate and validate the XML files. It returns the line number where the error is occurred. I highlighted this line with red colour and print the error message in the widget just below the editor. In this way, the user can recognize his/her error while editing the SDF file.

The editor switched to the [code editor of QT](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/widgets-codeeditor.html) from plain text editor in order to show the line numbers and highlight the current line. ![SDFValidator_V1](/images/SdfValid2-1024x726.png)
