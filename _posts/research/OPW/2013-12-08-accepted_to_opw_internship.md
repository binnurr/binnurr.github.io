I have just been accepted for [the OPW internship for the 7th round](http://www.osrfoundation.org/osrf-welcomes-our-opw-participants/). You can find detailed information about [the OPW internship program](https://wiki.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen#Application_Process "O") and the participating organizations and accepted interns for [the current period](https://wiki.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen/2013/DecemberMarch#Accepted_Participants "OPW 7th round 2013"). I will work with OSRFÂ  (Open Source Robotic Foundation) for the Gazebo project. I will integrate a SDF editor to Gazebo in order to allow changes in the model while the simulation is running. I wish I can do my best and develop a feature which the users can benefit. I feel excited to be in such a great internship period with wonderful people. Thanks to everyone for their helps in advance !
