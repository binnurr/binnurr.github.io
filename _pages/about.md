I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Engineering at Bogazici University, where I previously completed my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees. I am keenly interested in human-robot interaction, autonomous robots, and educational technologies. During my graduate studies, I was an active member of the CMPE Robotics Research Group and the Cerberus Robocup Standard Platform League team, where I gained experience in developing and implementing cutting-edge robotics technologies. I am a recipient of the prestigious Google Women Techmakers Scholarship. As an AI research scientist, I develop AI solutions for behavioral pairings and recommendations in call centers at [Afiniti](https://www.afiniti.com/){:target="_blank"}.
